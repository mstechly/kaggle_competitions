# Kaggle Plant Seedlings
Repository with my code for [Kaggle Plant Seedlings Classification Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/plant-seedlings-classification)

## Getting started

To run the code please open one of the notebooks.

## Library

I use [fast.ai library](https://github.com/fastai/fastai/tree/master/fastai).

## Data

In order to run the code you need to download the data from [the competition website](https://www.kaggle.com/c/plant-seedlings-classification/data) and put them into `data` directory.

To create sample set I used `sample-set-creator.ipynb`.
To create validation set I used `validation-set-creator.ipynb` .

Both of them are in the `utilities` directory.

## GPU

Since my computer doesn't have GPU, I used [Paperspace](www.paperspace.com)
